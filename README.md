# arduino-rpm-afr-meter
Arduino-based RPM and AFR meter with display


This project aims to create a device which can measure and display the operating RPM and AFR of a small combustion engine.


A Hall effect sensor is used to sense the magnet in the engine's flywheel passing by the sensor, which allows an Arduino microcontroller to find and display the RPM on a display.


A wideband O2 sensor in conjuction with a separate controller such as the Innovate LC-2 is used to measure the AFR, which is input to the Arduino to be output on the display.


A simple 16x2 LCD display will be used to show data.
